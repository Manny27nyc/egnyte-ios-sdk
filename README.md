# EgnyteSDK

SDK using Egnyteâ€™s Public API for your iOS projects.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+

## Integration

#### CocoaPods (iOS 8.0+)

You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `EgnyteSDK`by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
	pod 'EgnyteSDK'
end
```

Note that this requires CocoaPods version 1.1.0+, and your iOS deployment target to be at least 8.0:

#### Manually (iOS 8.0+)

To use this library in your project manually you may:  

1. For Projects, just drag Egnyte.swift to the project tree
2. For Workspaces, include the whole EgnyteSDK.xcodeproj

## Getting started
Get an API key, as described in [Getting an API key](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Getting_Started#Getting-an-API-Key).
If you need a domain for development, you can get one, as described in [Get a free Partner Domain](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Getting_Started#Get-a-Free-Partner-Domain).

### Authentication

Import

```swift
import EgnyteSDK
```

Initialize AuthRequest. You will find API key and Shared Secret [here](https://developers.egnyte.com/apps/mykeys)

```swift
let authRequest = AuthRequest.init(apiKey: "API_KEY",
                         		   sharedSecret: "SHARED_SECRET")
```

Initialize LoginService

```swift
// myViewController will present the necessary UI for a user to authenticate into Egnyte
let loginService = LoginService.init(presentingViewController: myViewController)
```

Perform auth request

```swift
loginService.performAuthRequest(authRequest) { result in
            do {
                let authResult = try result()
                self.token = authResult.token
				self.domainURL = authResult.egnyteDomainURL
            } catch let error {
                // handle error
            }
        }
```

### Creating APIClient instance

Once you have EgnyteAuthResult object, you can create APIClient that's capable of executing requests. Note that you should use only one instance per Egnyte domain.

```swift
let apiClient = EgnyteAPIClient.init(domainURL: domainURL, token: token)
```

### Executing requests

Create request by passing to initializer APIClient and required parameters. Then call on it `enqueue` which enqueues request to be executed by apiClient.

```swift
let folderContentRequest = ListFolderContentRequest.init(apiClient: apiClient,
                                                         path: "/Shared") { response in
    do {
        let folderContent = try response()
        // handle result
    } catch let error {
        // handle error
    }
}
        
folderContentRequest.enqueue()
```

## Sample App

A sample app can be found in the [SampleApp](./SampleApp/SampleApp) folder. The sample app demonstrates how to authenticate a user, and search, list, delete, upload, share, download files and folders.

To execute the sample app:
Install Pods
```
cd SampleApp
pod install
```
Open Workspace
```
open SampleApp.xcworkspace
```

Replace API_KEY and SHARED_SECRET in [MainViewController](./SampleApp/SampleApp/MainViewController.swift) with your API Key and Shared Secret.
```swift
// MainViewController.swift
static let API_KEY = "your api key"
static let SHARED_SECRET = "your shared secret"
```

## Tests

Tests can be found in the 'EgnyteSDKTests' target. [Use Xcode to execute the tests](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/05-running_tests.html).
